# Evo
A battle bot that uses plasma arcs to defeat its foes! It also has a easily replaceable/swappable horizontal spinner weapon and powerful motors all around. The plasma arcs won't do much to the opposing battlebot's electronics, but their main feature is melting and softening the outer shell. It has an adjustable length as well. I made this because I thought it was a really cool idea to see a plasma fire battle bot in action! I also wanted to get into RC more and battlebots overall are really cool and fun.
