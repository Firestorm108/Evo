Total Time: 12 Hours

June 16th-
Today I thought about the parts and design of the battlebot and created a BOM. I decided that I wanted to make a horizontal spinner battlebot, but with a twist. I thought it woild be super cool to add plasma arcs and so I did some research. Even cooler was that at a certain point of power, they become a sort of plasma flame that would be insanely effective. Thus, I got started on diagramming.

Time Spent: ~1 Hour

I made the wiring diagram and worked on the 3d printed parts for the battle bot. I also did quite a bit of progress on the CAD.

I spent a lot of time polishing and finishing up the final design for the battle bot. I was thinking about adding bare 8 gauge copper wire to make it easy to change the arc length but I decided that stripping thinner wire and tinning it would be a much cheaper option.

After careful consideration, I felt that the original horizontal spinner weapon would wear quickly and do little damage, so I designed a couple more weapons.

I ended up going with the one on the battlebot due to a good balance between many spikes and being sturdy.
I also finished up uploading, the BOMs, and the README.

After some constructive criticism from peers, I decided to move the wheels inward so they would be more protected.

I also decided to swap PETG for PLA due to superior impact resistance although I'd have to sacrifice some heat resistance as well.
I then changed the weapon a bit to be stronger yet still fulfill its purpose of guarding the plasma arcs.
